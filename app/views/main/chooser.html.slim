h2 Participate

p
  | In order to participate in an existing order, simply ask anyone for
    the link to the group basket. If for some reason copy and pasting is
    cumbersome, you can enter the basket ID manually here:

form method="GET" action="#{basket_path(uid: '')}"
  input required="required" name="uid" value="#{params[:uid]}"
  input type="submit" value="Use Basket"
